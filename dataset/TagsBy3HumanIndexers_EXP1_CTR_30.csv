First, I scan the article to look for key words that stick out to me- commonly repeated words that may be used as search terms. Then I read the article and think about its message, using key words from that message as tagging terms. Lastly I consider my general knowledge about the topic to consider whether there are other topics that may be relevant for research purposes. By this methodology I feel that I use general and specific tagging terms so all can find the information they need."2,11/7/12 16:11,,"Haiti, Tropical Storm Isaac, tropical storm, South
