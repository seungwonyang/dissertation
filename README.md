<strong>code</strong><br>
: This folder contains code for running Xpantrac.
<strong>dataset</strong><br>
: This folder has three datasets used in this study.  They are CTR_30 (homogeneous), VARIOUS_30 (heterogeneous), and NYT_1000 (New York Times articles).
<strong>script</strong><br>
: Scripts for text preprocessing are included in this folder
<strong>survey</strong><br>
: Survey documents (e.g., demographic, task, and exit surveys) for Experiment 1 (topic indexing), Experiment 2 (topic relevance rating), and Experiment 4 (usability study) are included in this folder. Experiment 3 was about applying Xpantrac to a larger dataset (NYT_1000), and did not involve human intervention, so there are no survey documents.
